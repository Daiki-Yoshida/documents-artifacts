# Host and Container Responsibilities

Read this for Docker-first boundaries, mounts, caches, networks, ports, secrets, or runtime resource reuse.

## Default responsibility split

Host normally owns:

- Docker/Compose;
- Git;
- command entry/routing;
- authentication/remote tooling.

Managed project/container environment normally owns:

- language runtime/package manager;
- compiler/build/test tools;
- DB/migration/project-specific CLI.

Do not install host runtimes merely because container commands feel inconvenient. Document any deliberate host exception and how version drift is controlled.

## Docker-first execution

Run build/test/lint/format/migration/project CLI through repository-managed definitions where practical.

Avoid hidden dependence on:

- manually created global containers/networks;
- host-global packages;
- unpinned critical `latest` tooling.

Respect lock files inside containers too.

## Resource identity and reuse

Use deterministic, human-readable identity based on project/component/role and, only when isolation requires it, Work Identity.

Do not create separate images/networks/volumes simply because a branch/worktree exists.

Reuse safely shareable caches/images. Separate mutable state only when parallelism, isolation, configuration, or project rules require it.

## Mounts and ownership

Files generated into host bind mounts should remain editable/removable by the host user.

Prefer UID/GID-aware solutions rather than running the entire container as root.

Keep caches/build outputs out of Git unless deliberately source-controlled.

## Ports and networks

Prefer internal container networking when host exposure is unnecessary.

When parallel isolated runtimes need host ports, allocate them explicitly by scope rather than letting Work instances collide.

## Secrets

- never bake secrets into images or commit them;
- separate samples from real values;
- avoid printing secrets in logs/diagnostics/CI;
- use appropriate build-time/runtime secret mechanisms;
- routine build/test should not require AI to read secret values.
