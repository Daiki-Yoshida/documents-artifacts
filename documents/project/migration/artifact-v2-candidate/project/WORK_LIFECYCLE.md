# Work Lifecycle and Resources

Read this when deciding when a Work is complete, what resources belong to it, or what must be reconciled/cleaned.

## Lifecycle

```text
goal established
  → design/discussion
  → Work Identity confirmed
  → Work Documents
  → branch/checkout/optional worktree
  → required work-scoped runtime
  → implementation
  → verification
  → integration
  → reconcile durable Work Documents
  → reconcile/clean work-scoped resources
  → Work complete
```

A merged branch in one repository does not necessarily complete a multi-repository Work.

## Resource scopes

**Project-scoped** — safely shared and longer-lived than one Work, e.g. immutable caches/shared images where appropriate.

**Work-scoped** — owned by one Work, e.g. branch, optional worktree, isolated mutable runtime/database, required port allocation, logs, Work Documents, work outputs.

**Run-scoped** — one command/test execution. It is still ownership-wise under the Work; do not create a new Work Identity for every run.

## Do not clone everything per Work

Work Identity is not a reason to create:

- a new image for every Work;
- duplicate caches/networks/volumes without isolation need;
- a worktree for every task;
- a separate state database just for management.

Reuse safe Project-scoped state. Isolate only when mutable state, parallelism, configuration, or project rules require it.

## Completion state for work-scoped resources

Every actually-created Work-scoped resource must end as one of:

```yaml
removed:
  meaning: "No longer needed and removed through scoped cleanup."

intentionally_retained:
  meaning: "Kept for a concrete follow-up use; resource and reason are reported."
```

An unexplained leftover with unknown owner/purpose is not a valid completion state.

Do not delete shared/persistent resources merely because the Work used them.

## Work Documents completion

Reconcile durable confirmed information into Project Documentation. Drop work-only hypotheses/logs when no longer needed. Use Git history for the past; do not build a parallel archive system.
